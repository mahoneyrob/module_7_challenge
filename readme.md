# Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine which employees were close to retiring at the company Pewlett Hackard.  

## Results
### Major Points
	- There are slightly over 90,000 employees who are close to retirement, with an age in their late to mid 60's.
	- More than half (about 64%) are senior level employees.
	- There are about 1550 employees in their mid 50's that could be involved in a mentorship program.
	- About half of those retiring are Engineers.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation, however, the bigger issue is that there are no employees that are under the age of 50 (This is assuming that the data is accurate to today's date).  I ran a query that looked at active employees born after 1970, and no results were returned.  It seems to be accurate as there are also no employees born before 1952.  The workforce at the company all seem to have been born between 1953 and 1965.
